Onward. Current idea: finding analogous players in the dataset based on sought after players in the premier league.

Premise: every team wishes they could sign sought after Premier League transfer targets like Adam Wharton, Antonee Robinson, and Murillo (some of the players who look most likely to make a big time move in upcoming Prem windows). However, for the vast majority of teams in the world, their recruiting pool and finances do not allow them to shop in the Prem. How can teams identify which players in their recruiting pools profile like these highly effective top level players?

Methodology: use FBREF scraping and other data to create a general profile for each player. Then, use SkillCorner data to accurately find which players are effective in these ways in our data. Limited by the open data, we assume the team we are working for is of the level to be shopping in Australia and we ignore sample size. All code will be mutable to work with any amount of data.
